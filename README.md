![task-2 output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d8dad1a-1456-47bd-8432-b3bb78519f2d)


**Objective**:

The objective of a simple calculator is to perform basic arithmetic operations to assist users in solving mathematical problems quickly and accurately. Typically, a simple calculator can handle operations such as:

**Addition (+)**: Summing two or more numbers.

**Subtraction (−)**: Finding the difference between two numbers.

**Multiplication (×)**: Calculating the product of two or more numbers.

**Division (÷)**: Determining how many times one number is contained within another.

The goal is to provide a straightforward tool for everyday calculations without the complexity of more advanced functions found in scientific or graphing calculators. #task-2


**Key Activities:**

Input Handling: Accepting user inputs through numerical keys (0-9) and operational keys (+, −, ×, ÷), as well as special functions like the decimal point and equals (=) button.

Operation Execution: Carrying out arithmetic operations based on user input:

**Addition**: Adding two or more numbers.

**Subtraction**: Subtracting one number from another.

**Multiplication:** Multiplying two or more numbers.

**Division:** Dividing one number by another.

**Display:** Showing the current input, intermediate results, and final results on the screen. This includes updating the display as operations are performed.

**Calculation:** Performing the actual mathematical computations based on user commands and input values.


**TECHNOLOGIES USED:**

A Python-based to-do list can be built using the following technologies:

**Firmware:** The software embedded in the calculator's microcontroller or microprocessor that handles the arithmetic operations and user interface. It is responsible for processing input, performing calculations, and controlling the display.

**Algorithms:** Simple algorithms are used to perform arithmetic operations. These algorithms handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as basic error checking.
